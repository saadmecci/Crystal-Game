# week-4-game

Crystal number game that I made while enrolled in the Fullstack Bootcamp at UT.

It uses bootstrap and css for the layout and styling, jQuery and javascript for the logic.

The user has to try to get to the random target score by clicking on the 4 cyrstals.

The value of each crystal is hidden until the user clicks on the crystal.

This value is stored and remains the same until the user reaches the target number and wins or goes over the target number and loses.

Game will reset after every win or loss without having to refresh the page.
